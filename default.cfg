## This ist the default configuration of tcp2maxima.
## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
## Instead copy it to /etc/tcp2maxima.cfg or ~/.tcp2maxima.cfg
## And set the values that you want to change.
## It's considered good practice to only override the values you need
## to change.

[General]
# This is not used at the moment!
daemon = 0
# The loglevel can be set to the usual
# loglevels allowed by the python loggin module
# ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
loglevel = DEBUG

[Daemon]
# The directory where the pid file is stored. This is used 
# to keep track of the daemon process and to make sure
# we don't have multiple instances running.
# Make sure you choose something which is writeable
# by the user who starts the process
pid_dir = /var/run/

# The directory where the log file is stored. At the moment
# tcp2maxima isn't intended as a user process. Therefor
# stdout will always be written to a log file in this 
# directory. Make sure it's writeable by the user who
# starts the process
log_dir = /var/log/

# Specifies the user who owns the daemon process. This 
# won't work unless you start the daemon as root.
user = beni 

[Server]
# Adress and port to listen to. If you specify localhost, remote
# connections are not allowed. If you specify the address
# of a network interface, tcp2maxima will accept any requests
# to that address and they are passed on to maxima 
# practically unfiltered. So make sure you have security mesures
# in place before changing this to anything which isn't localhost.
address = localhost
port = 9666

[Maxima]
# The maxima executable on the system providing the absolute path
# It won't work if the executable doesn't exist.
path = /usr/bin/maxima

## Specifies how many maxima instances are used to process queries.
threads = 3

## Specifies how many seconds we should wait for maxima before we
## consider it a timed out querie.
timeout = 10

## The nice value of the maxima processes. This manages how unix 
## distributes the cpu ressources. If you also run a webserver
## on the same machine as the maxima processes, it's a goot idea
## to set this to something between 15 and 19. Comment it out
## if you don't need it.

# nice = 19

## This string is passed to maxima before it starts processing
## queries.

init = reset()$kill(all)$display2d:false$linel:10000$

# This string is passed to maxima after processing a query
# to reset the maxima process before it processes another
# query. Make sure you reset maxima properly. Otherwise
# strange errors might occur resulting from earlyer inputs.
reset = reset()$kill(all)$display2d:false$linel:10000$
